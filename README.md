# FCC Drum Machine Challenge

I wrote this to fulfill the requirements of the freeCodeCamp [Drum Machine](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-drum-machine) challenge.

The design is inspired by the legendary [LM-1 drum machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linn_LM-1). That's the drum machine you hear on 'In The Air Tonight" by Phil Colins.

Check it out on [stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-ts-xuq87v) or play the [demo](https://react-ts-xuq87v.stackblitz.io_).

Click the drum pads, or use Q W E A S D Z X C key bindings to trigger the drums.
